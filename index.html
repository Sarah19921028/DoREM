   <h1>The Dream Dictionary</h1>
    <p>The Dream Dictionary is a resource to help you interpret the symbols and themes in your dreams. It contains a list of common dream elements along with their possible meanings. 
        Use this dictionary to gain insights into your subconscious mind and better understand the messages your dreams may be conveying.</p>
    <p>Keep in mind the definitions provided are <u>common interpretations</u> and there are symbols in your own dreams that may mean something personal to you. 
    For example... dreaming about flying may be fun for some and terrifying for others. 
    It is encouraged to use the Dream Dictionary highlighting tool to track repeating symbols or reoccuring dreams to help track and understand the personal connection to specific elements.</p>
